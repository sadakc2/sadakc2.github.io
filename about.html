		<h2>Education</h2>
		
                <p>I am currently a senior computer science major at Winthrop Univerisity with minors in math, geography
			and biology. Some of my favorite classes at Winthrop have been Calculus 3, Data Structures,
			Geospatial Technologies, and Zoology.</p>
		 <p>In addition to my academics, I took on a new role this year as a Peer Mentor. I am thrilled about this 
			because I now have a class of 19 freshmen whom I teach once a week for an hour and fifteen minutes. 
			I also get to interact them individually and help guide them through their transition from high school
			to college.</p>
		
		<h2>Interests, Hobbies, and Favorites</h2>
		
		<p>Some of my academic and potential career interests include software development, geospatial technologies, 
			and biomedical technologies. I love problem solving while being creative and I believe
			I would thrive in an environment that fostered both of those parts of my personality.</p>
		<p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on fun development projects (like this website). I also love to play music. 
			In high school I played the clarinet in concert band and I played the marimba and tenor drums in marching band.
			I continued playing in college through my sophomore year until I got too busy to devote enough time to 
			practice. I was able to travel with the Winthrop University Wind Symphony to New York City and play on the
			Carnegie Hall stage as featured ensemble for the Sounds of Spring Music Festival. I also love volunteering
			at my local church on Sundays and helping with the little kids that attend in Kid Spring.</p>
		<p>A few of my favorite things include animals (all animals, but specifically cats), spending time with family
			and friends, shopping, Fall (pumpkins, flannels, fires, the whole 9 yards), watching Hallmark Chanel Christmas
			movies, and Pretty Little Liars.</p>
