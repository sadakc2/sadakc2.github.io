		<h2> WELCOME</h2>
		
                <p>Thanks for visiting my page! As this website grows I will be posting side-projects, photos, etc.
                Please feel free to contact me using any of the options at the bottom of the page.</p>
		
		<h2>FAMILY</h2>
		
		<p>Mom, Dad, Rachel, Domino, Sparkle. Before you ask, no, my sister and I are not twins.</p>

	<h2> EDUCATION</h2>
		
                <p>Senior computer science major at Winthrop Univerisity. Minors in math, geography
			and biology.</p>
	    	<p>Fav classes: Software Engineering, Data Structures, Calculus 3, Geospatial Technologies, Zoology.</p>
		
	<h2> 2018 PEER MENTOR</h2>
	    
	    	<p>In addition to my academics, I took on a new role this year as a Peer Mentor. I am thrilled about this 
			because I now have a class of 19 freshmen whom I teach once a week for an hour and fifteen minutes. 
			I get to form personal relationships with each of them and help guide them through their transition from high school
			to college.</p>
		
	<h2> INTERESTS | HOBBIES | FAVS</h2>
		
		<p>Some of my academic and career interests include software development, geospatial technologies, 
			and biomedical technologies. I love problem solving while being creative and I believe
			I would thrive in an environment that encourages both of these parts of my personality.</p>
		<p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on fun development projects (like this website). I also love to play music. 
			In high school I played the clarinet in concert band and I played the marimba and tenor drums in marching band.
			I continued playing in college through my sophomore year until I got too busy to devote enough time to 
			practice. I was able to travel with the Winthrop University Wind Symphony to New York City and play on the
			Carnegie Hall stage as the featured ensemble for the Sounds of Spring Music Festival. I also love volunteering
			with the youth ministry at my local church on Sundays.</p>
		<p>A few of my favorite things include animals (all animals, but specifically cats), spending time with family
			and friends, shopping, Fall (literally everything about it), watching Hallmark Chanel Christmas
			movies, and Pretty Little Liars.</p>
